## Voice Activity Detector
Given a voice signal, the goal is to determine at which moments there is actually voice and at which there is only silence (or noise). These systems have various applications, such as in teleconferencing systems, speech coding systems, speech recognition, etc. The fundamental criterion for discerning whether a segment is voice or silence will be its average power. In low-noise situations, it is expected that the power of the noise will be much lower than that of the voice. Therefore, a first approach to the problem would be to calculate a threshold such that, if the power exceeds this threshold, we decide that the segment contains voice; and if it does not, we decide that it contains silence. Other criteria, such as the zero-crossing rate and the length of the silences, are also used.

## Pitch Detection
The goal is to design a pitch detection system based on autocorrelation. The autocorrelation of a periodic signal is itself periodic with the same period as the signal. Since every signal presents the maximum autocorrelation at the origin, by detecting the position of the second maximum, we are able to determine this period.
